## tl;dr Code monkey turned landworker

My name is Tom Readings. I am a recovering agency coder.

In 2022 I jumped ship from working for ~10 years as an agency web developer, to
work in a field. I had worked with a lot of very nice folk in two forward
thinking and progresive django shops. I burnt out.

I am very pleased with my decision. Landworkers rock.

Seed sovereignty for all.
